How to Run Me
1) Set a path to where you have all R script
   It can be accomplished by these two commands:
   getwd()
   setwd()

2) Load all the R scripts to the R using this command:
   Source("NameOfScript.R") Where NameOfScript is the name used to save the script. 

3) Run the Script, CoverageProbability, as shown below:

   Choose the option :
   1 - Validation model
   2 - Corrupted distribution : symetric distribution
   3 - Asymetric distribution
   4 - Skewed distribution : Gamma
   5 - Very Skewed distribution : Exponential

   Example , option <- 1 # It chooses and runs only the validation model

   iteration <- 1000

   N_ Group <- 10 ,20... or 200 % Number of Units . Note : Any even number .
   TimeVector <- c (0 ,10 ,20 ,30 ,40) or c (0 ,10 ,20 ,30 ,40 ,50 ,60 ,70)
   MAX <- 9 % The maximum column number of a matrix
   Step _ Size <- 10
   Start <- 0


Note: Make sure all the four scripts in a folder are loaded to R before running a model of an option; otherwise, it will indicate that a script is not found.
      Each folder is named according to the value of option that selects and runs the model. For example:
      option <- 1 # Validation Model
      option <- 2 # Symmetric corrupted distribution
      option <- 3 # Asymmetric corrupted distribution
      option <- 4 # Gamma distribution
      option <- 5 # Exponential distribution
